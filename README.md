# Computer Networks Sessional
This repository contains assignments for the CSE 322: Computer Networks Sessional course offered by the CSE Department of BUET. 

# Contents
- [Offline 1](Offline%201): Socket Programming
- [Online 1](Online%201): Packet Tracer
- [Project NS3](Project%20NS3): Term Project Using *NS3*

### Note
The Term Project was done in *NS3*, a network simulator. The project was divided into 2 Tasks. 

#### Task A
Implemented n-node dumbbell topology. Two Simulations were done:
- Wireless high-rate (e.g. 802.11) (static)
- Wireless low-rate (e.g. 802.15.4) (static)

#### Task B
Implementation of an existing congestion control algorithm. My implementation is based on [TCP-Adaptive Reno](Project%20NS3/Submission/Paper.pdf).

All details of the implementations are provided in [Report.pdf](Project%20NS3/Submission/Report.pdf).
